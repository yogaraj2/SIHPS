## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
An E-waste Facility Locator tackles the challenge of responsible e-waste disposal by connecting users with nearby drop-off locations. This user-friendly platform allows people to search for facilities based on their location and provides details like accepted items, hours of operation, and any associated fees. It also educates users on what constitutes e-waste and the importance of proper recycling.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
Designing an E-Waste Facility Locator would involve creating a system that allows users to input their location and then provides them with the nearest E-Waste recycling facilities. The proposed solution would involve the following components:

User Interface (UI): A simple interface for users to input their location, either through manual entry or automatic geolocation.

Location Services: The system would use location services to determine the user's current location.

Database of E-Waste Facilities: A comprehensive and up-to-date database of E-Waste recycling facilities, including their location, contact information, and hours of operation.

Algorithm for Determining Nearest Facilities: An algorithm that uses the user's location and the database of facilities to determine the nearest E-Waste recycling centers.

Routing Services: Integration with mapping and routing services to provide users with directions to the nearest facilities.

User Experience (UX): A focus on creating a seamless and user-friendly experience, making it easy for users to find and recycle their E-Waste. The architecture diagram for such a system could look like this:

## Use Cases
Locating Nearby Facilities: Users can find the nearest e-waste recycling centers or drop-off points, making it convenient for them to responsibly dispose of their electronic waste. This helps in preventing e-waste from being improperly disposed of in landfills,which can harm the environment.

Awareness and Education: The locator can also serve as an educational tool, providing information about the importance of e-waste recycling and the potential environmental hazards associated with improper disposal.

Regulatory Compliance: Businesses and organizations can use the locator to ensure compliance with e-waste regulations.

Promoting Sustainable Practices: By encouraging individuals and businesses to recycle their electronic waste, the locator promotes sustainable practices and contributes to the conservation of natural resources.

Data Collection and Analysis: The use of a locator can also help in gathering data on e-waste disposal patterns, such as the types and quantities of electronic devices being recycled and the geographic distribution of recycling activities.

## Technology Stack
Front-end Development:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building the user interface and handling interactive elements on the website or application.

Back-end Development: Node.js, Python, or Java

A database system (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)

Authentication: Implementing user authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to secure user accounts and access to certain features.

Authorization: Setting up authorization rules to control access to administrative features or sensitive data within the application.

## Dependencies
Mapping API: Dependency on Google Maps API for location services and displaying e-waste facility locations.

Third-Party APIs: Integration with APIs for credit points calculation and possibly for accessing e-waste facility data.

Educational Content: Dependence on reliable sources for educational content on e-waste and environmental impact. By implementing this solution, EcoRecycle can provide a user-friendly platform for responsible e-waste disposal, educate users on environmental issues, and incentivize sustainable behavior.
